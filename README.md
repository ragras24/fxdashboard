# FX Insights Dashboard
A Python-based dashboard that reads pre-cleaned CSV datasets to forecast exchange rates. Built on two modeling layers: a linear regression scorecard and a gradient boosting error correction model.

## Description
Global foreign exchange dynamics are undergoing rapid transformation, driven by rising geopolitical tensions, shifting trade policies, and evolving macroeconomic conditions. These developments challenge the effectiveness of traditional USD forecasting techniques and complicate efforts to understand the drivers of volatility—making it harder for businesses to make informed decisions and hedge against currency risk. The FX Insights Dashboard addresses this complexity by offering a systematic, transparent framework to assess USD strength relative to key global currencies — AUD, CAD, EUR, GBP, and JPY. By combining traditional indicators with non-traditional market signals, the dashboard translates real-time macro and financial data into actionable currency insights.

At its core, the Scorecard provides:
1) A directional signal for USD movement
2) Transparent attribution of key drivers
3) Flexibility to adjust inputs based on user expectations or judgment

Whether you're a strategist, investor, or student of macroeconomics, this tool simplifies FX forecasting and quantitatively highlights which factors contribute most to currency volatility without sacrificing analytical depth.
